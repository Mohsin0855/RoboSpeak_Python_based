This Python script allows you to make your device speak out the text you enter. It uses the `pyttsx3` library to convert text to speech.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3 library

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pyttsx3`.
3. Run the script by executing `python main.py`.
4. Enter the text you want your device to speak. To exit the program, type 'q'.
